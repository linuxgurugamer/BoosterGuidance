# BoosterGuidance




# Procedure for Realism Overhaul Boostback

use 9 merlin engines
falcon 9 booster
large grid fins

Ascent
- use 150km target orbit,
- use all engines for ascent
- BoosterGuidance settings
    - reentry burn alt: 70,000m
    - reentry target speed: 700m/s
    - Reentry burn max AoA 10 degress
    - Ascent max AoA 10 degrees
    - Powered descent max AoA 0 degrees
- Enable boostback with all 9 engines at 40km
- Before boostback ends switch to 3 engines (to avoid overshoot) - set up engines groups on action groups
- When target error is minimize and coasting enable deply gridfins with key B
-
