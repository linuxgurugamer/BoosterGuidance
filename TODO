- Apply air brakes automatically
- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Can't pick targets on Mun when at 55km and above (due to distance of ray or buildings)
- Doesn't really work on other planets!! Target point seems to drift (may be just drawing)
- More reliable clicking to set target (due to distance of ray or buildings)
- Set target on sea should be sea level (not <0m)
- Set target anywhere on map view (due to distance of ray)
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Fix unreliability of landing leg deployment
- Respect throttle limiting settings
