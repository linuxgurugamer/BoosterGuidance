- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Target is visible from wrong side of planet
- Prediction target shifts and jumps sometimes on Mun. Possibly only on timewarp and fixed?
- Keep thrust high for re-entry when velocity means predicted impact is moving fast away from us (activate from orbit)
- sometimes problem with sharing violation on logging when enable/disable guidance
- Compute distance from ground wherever you are landing
- Tool tips
- When on mun on aero descent predicted land spot drifts away and then returns to target every 1-2 secs sometimes between 0 to 800m error or similar. Why?
- on time warp on Mun crash seems to jump location (I think)
- report helpful message about crashing and upping touchdown margin?
