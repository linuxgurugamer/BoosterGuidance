- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Fix unreliability of landing leg deployment. Use Gear ActionGroup ?
- Target is visible from wrong side of planet
- Prediction target shifts and jumps sometimes on Mun. Possibly only on timewarp and fixed?
- Keep thrust high for re-entry when velocity means predicted impact is moving fast away from us (activate from orbit)
- Use click-through preventer
- Neaten set to nav point message. Too many decimal points
- Landing burn max AoA always 0
- Target locations switch on vessel switch, but target not at the correct place
- Prediction target still shows when no controller enabled
- MaxAoA not set correctly when starting
- Sort out filename for logging with Core
