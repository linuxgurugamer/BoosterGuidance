- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Fix unreliability of landing leg deployment
- Doesn't move target of activate navigation and its already activated on another target
- Target is visible from wrong side of planet
- Prediction target shifts and jumps sometimes on Mun. Possibly only on timewarp and fixed?
- Switching vessels doesn't show the correct target/prediction. Show multiple targets for multiple vessels?
- Sometimes target is not shown with Pick Target (not enabled?)
- Keep thrust high for re-entry when velocity means predicted impact is moving fast away from us (activate from orbit)
