- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Fix unreliability of landing leg deployment. Use Gear ActionGroup ? Works in KSP 1.11 for Falcon
- Target is visible from wrong side of planet
- Prediction target shifts and jumps sometimes on Mun. Possibly only on timewarp and fixed?
- Keep thrust high for re-entry when velocity means predicted impact is moving fast away from us (activate from orbit)
- sometimes problem with sharing violation on logging when enable/disable guidance
- Add info message which give hints about settings: touchdown margin, no steer height and touchdown speed
- Compute distance from ground wherever you are landing
- Messages when switching phase and reason why
- Tool tips
