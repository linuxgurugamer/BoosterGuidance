- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Fix unreliability of landing leg deployment. Use Gear ActionGroup ? Works in KSP 1.11 for Falcon
- Target is visible from wrong side of planet
- Prediction target shifts and jumps sometimes on Mun. Possibly only on timewarp and fixed?
- Keep thrust high for re-entry when velocity means predicted impact is moving fast away from us (activate from orbit)
- sometimes problem with sharing violation on logging when enable/disable guidance
- sometimes massive prediction target shows
- Both targets sometimes too big. Odd because size is calculated every frame they are drawn
- Add info message which give hints about settings: touchdown margin, no steer height and touchdown speed
- Compute distance from ground wherever you are landing
- Failure to show AdvancedTab as NullReference to previous controller? possibly fixed
- Lots of BoosterGuidanceCore.OnDestroy() exceptions with reference to non-instance (BLController). Why?
- Landing Burn steer direction wrong for large test craft. Things aerodynamics dominates but it doesn't
- Is setting the landing burn engines working correctly?
