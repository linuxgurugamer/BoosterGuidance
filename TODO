Guides Boosters to landing site from orbit, aka. Falcon 9

- Apply air brakes
- Deploy gear
- Tidy up targets when crashed
- Add target on map
- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- Don't add icon twice
- Consider air resitance and terminal velocity meaning thrust can be applied later than appears?
- Report whether landing is possible (useful when changing number of engines activated and considering fuel load)
- Smoothly release thrust in re-entry burn to steer evenly
- Prevent target becoming below zero!!
- Smooth out error
- Stop wild oscillations when near landing, approx 5km?, try Kd again?
- Work out why logging fails sometimes
- Show targets on Map view
- Gain setting with FA/FT are the wrong way around!!!! need 1/gain !!!!

NOTES:
- KSPTrajectories. Look at ComputeForces in AerodynamicModel/VesselAerodynamicModel.cs to set AoA
