Guides Boosters to landing site from orbit, aka. Falcon 9

- Apply air brakes
- Deploy gear
- Tidy up targets when crashed
- Add target on map
- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- Don't add icon twice
- Consider air resitance and terminal velocity meaning thrust can be applied later than appears?
- Report whether landing is possible (useful when changing number of engines activated and considering fuel load)
- Smoothly apply and release thrust in re-entry burn to steer evenly
- make sure orientation is correct before starting re-entry burn
- Make it work on map view
- Prevent target becoming too small

- KSPTrajectories. Look at ComputeForces in AerodynamicModel/VesselAerodynamicModel.cs to set AoA
