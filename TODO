Guides Boosters to landing site from orbit, aka. Falcon 9

Does
- Boostback to target: lat/lon or vessel
- Coasting phase
- Re-entry burn
- Powered Descent

Parameters boostback
- Min Boostback error? (or just get a close as can)
- Use RCS to steer if available, otherwise use minimum thrust
- Aim at this altitude above landing site

Re-entry burn
- Altitude for re-entry burn
- Target max velocity

Aero Descent
- Altitude to apply air brakes
- Gain on steering
- Max Angle-of-Attack

Powered Descent
- Keep steering with aim direction until under given velocity
- Once under velocity use thrust for steering, up to max angle

Logging

Other
- Can toggle on and off for manual control
- Show predicted target
