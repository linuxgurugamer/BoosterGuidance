- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Fix unreliability of landing leg deployment
- Target is visible from wrong side of planet
- Prediction target shifts and jumps sometimes on Mun. Possibly only on timewarp and fixed?
- Keep thrust high for re-entry when velocity means predicted impact is moving fast away from us (activate from orbit)
- Don't show landing target for vessel when guidance has been reset, i.e lat=lon=alt=0
- Save landing engines with vessel settings
- Not saving vessel settings to multiple cores
- Setting navigation doesn't save lat/lon/alt, it gets messed up when switching vessels
- Slow to open BoosterGuidance window. 1-2 secs. Why?
- Switching vessels. Guidance enabled lost
