- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Fix unreliability of landing leg deployment
- Doesn't move target of activate navigation and its already activated on another target
- Target is visible from wrong side of planet
- Prediction target shifts and jumps sometimes on Mun. Possibly only on timewarp and fixed?
- Switching vessels doesn't show the correct target/prediction. Show multiple targets for multiple vessels?
- Sometimes target is not shown with Pick Target (not enabled?)
- Keep thrust high for re-entry when velocity means predicted impact is moving fast away from us (activate from orbit)
- With multiple vessel when they separate by >30km (physics calc. limit) they lose guidance (due to a new Vessel being a clone I think).
  Identify from name rather than Vessel pointer? Might cause clashes, would still need to re-attach the Vessel reference to fly the vessel though. Loop through active vessels?
- Don't show predicted target when guidance not enabled on vessel
- Don't show landing target for vessel when guidance has been reset, i.e lat=lon=alt=0
