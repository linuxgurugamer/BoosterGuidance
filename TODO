- On RO picking target jumps around. Store double's?
- In low gravity use larger dt as time to compute goes from 1ms (Kerbin) to 10-12ms and flight time 460 secs
- Put engine shutdown code in again?
- Fix unreliability of landing leg deployment. Use Gear ActionGroup ? Works in KSP 1.11 for Falcon
- Target is visible from wrong side of planet
- Prediction target shifts and jumps sometimes on Mun. Possibly only on timewarp and fixed?
- Keep thrust high for re-entry when velocity means predicted impact is moving fast away from us (activate from orbit)
- Use click-through preventer
- Prediction target still shows when no controller enabled
- Sometimes steers away from target at very high AoA with small test craft. retrograde+AoA wrong?. only 12 degree attitude error, but AoA 50+ degrees
- problems with sharing violation on logging when enable/disable guidance
- sometimes massive prediction target shows
- Both targets sometimes too big. Force redraw?
